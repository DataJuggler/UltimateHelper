# UltimateHelper
This library is a collection of helper classes that make working with C# much easier.

This package was originally for .Net Framework, then ported to .Net Core, and now the latest version is for .NET 7.
For .NET6 use a 6.x version and for .NET5 use a 5.x version. All new development is on .NET7 (or later).

I am working on updating my Read Me's, sorry.

I do have many complete opensource projects that use this package (DataJuggler.UltimateHelper), here are few of my favorites:

Blazor Excelerate<br>
